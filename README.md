# Getting Started

The world is shifting from a ‚Äúvalue capturing‚Äù economy to a ‚Äúvalue creation‚Äù economy and needs a new set of rules, which democratize access to resources for creators and make value creation as rewarding as it should be in the 21st century.

We believe that in near future most resources except intellectual and human capital will become commodities. As a producer of knowledge-based assets, creative industries will become the major drivers of economic growth in the world. 

## Why DEIP?

DEIP infrastructure is an application-specific Substrate 3.0 based Polkadot Parachain that implements a number of protocols for the creative economy: the core protocol is Intellectual Capital Protocol. 

We not only propose a set of protocols \([Intellectual Capital Protocol](https://docs.deip.world/developers/deip-intellectual-capital-protocol), [Dynamic Liquidity Protocol](https://docs.deip.world/protocol/dynamic-liquidity-protocol), [Intangible Assets Yield Farming Protocol](https://docs.deip.world/protocol/yield-farming), [Collective Intelligence Protocol](https://docs.deip.world/protocol/collective-intelligence-protocol)\) that have the potential to dramatically increase the liquidity of intangible assets but also outline a set of tools and strategies on how to bring the high-value assets to this protocol and drive adoption of Web3 space in general. 

We are focusing on creative industries now and creating the most advanced decentralized protocol for the creative economy. We want to make it a foundational infrastructure for unlocking the full potential of creators around the world. 

## What is our mission?

Our mission is to drive the adoption of Web 3.0 technologies for creative economy use-cases and boost the liquidity of intangible assets. We work to maximize the realization of global human and intellectual capital.

## What is DEIP Protocol?

DEIP Protocol \(or Intellectual Capital Protocol\) is a Web 3.0 Layer-2 application-specific protocol for intangible assets and derivatives. The protocol enables discovering, evaluation, licensing, and exchange of intangible assets. It is designed specifically for intangible assets tokenization \(as [F-NFT](learn/tokenized-intangible-assets-f-nfts.md)\), [governance ](learn/governance.md)\(via DAO\), and [liquidity](learn/dynamic-liquidity-protocol.md) \(via DeFi instruments and derivatives\). 

The Intellectual Capital Protocol serves as a base protocol for multiple specific protocols implemented on top of it:  [Dynamic Liquidity Protocol](https://docs.deip.world/protocol/dynamic-liquidity-protocol), [Intangible Assets Yield Farming Protocol](https://docs.deip.world/protocol/yield-farming), [Collective Intelligence Protocol](https://docs.deip.world/protocol/collective-intelligence-protocol).

## DEIP&Polkadot Parachain

As an application-specific Substrate 3.0 based Polkadot Parachain we want to convince you of the legitimacy of our project. 

![](.gitbook/assets/screenshot_1.png)

1. DEIP has successfully applied for a Web3 Grant that can be found in the [Accepted Grant Applications](https://github.com/w3f/General-Grants-Program/blob/master/grants/accepted_grant_applications.md) list. 
2. As an open-source project, we want to share our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/DEIPworld/deip-polkadot). We are convinced that open source code promotes transparency, builds trust, and ensures that nothing suspicious happens behind the scenes.
3. Also, we want to share our well-written and detailed [Whitepaper](https://docsend.com/view/nx375c2v85g2rk6c). 
4. And of course, we want to show you [the people](https://www.deip.world/team) who created the project that will change the world.

## Getting Started

Before you start we recommend you learn how blockchain works: 

* The [Blockchain Fundamentals MOOC course](https://mooc.web3.foundation/course/blockchain-fundamentals/), developed by Web3 Foundation, is a great introduction to start familiarizing yourself with blockchain concepts such as cryptography and networks, and how these play into things like decentralization and cryptocurrency. 

This course will be useful for beginners of blockchain and for those who need to refresh their knowledge in the blockchain.

### For beginners of DEIP

DEIP Documentation space consists of some modules:

* LEARN - Everything you should know about DEIP Infrastructure and its components: Protocol, Portals, Governance, and Network.
* BUILD - You will learn how to build an IP-centric Web3 platform in weeks. Also, we hope that you will find our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/DEIPworld/deip-polkadot) helpful. 
* MAINTAIN - Represents a set of operations that act like building blocks to compose solutions for Portal-specific services.
