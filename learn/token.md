# Token

## What is DEIP token?

DEIP token is the native token of the DEIP Network. It serves three major functions in the network:

* **Utility -** DEIP token is the native payment/currency/fee token \(e.g. fee for native transactions, smart contracts, etc.\)
* **Governance -** DEIP token provides holders with voting rights to elect Validators and Council members, and to adjust key network parameters through referendums
* **Staking and yield farming -** Network participants can stake DEIP tokens on a specific F-NFT segment farm yield of underlying intangible assets

## Staking

DEIP tokens can be staked to participate in the governance of the DEIP Network. In general, there are three major opportunities if you stake DEIP tokens:

1. Become a validator in the network, authorize blocks in the chain, and earn a reward for this
2. Compete for a seat on the DEIP[ Council](governance.md#council), earn a reward and part of the profit from the DEIP Ecosystem Fund
3. Participate in industry competition by making a bet on the performance of a specific segment of IP assets in the network, increase the amount of capital allocated for this segment in DEIP Ecosystem Fund, and earn a part of profits via yield farming
