# Creator Economy Protocol

The Creator Economy Protocol is a Web 3.0, domain-specific protocol for intangible assets and derivatives. The protocol enables the discovery, evaluation, licensing, and exchange of intangible assets. It is designed specifically for[ intangible asset tokenization](tokenized-intangible-assets-f-nfts.md) \(F-NFT\), [governance ](../governance.md)\(via DAO\), and [liquidity](dynamic-liquidity-protocol.md) \(via DeFi instruments and derivatives\). 

The Creator Economy Protocol is a fundamental protocol of DEIP's infrastructure. It represents a set of operations that act like building blocks to compose solutions for Portal-specific services. 

An operation is the smallest unit of the protocol dedicated to modify the state of a blockchain relying on predefined rules. Multiple operations can be combined into a transaction to be executed atomically. A composition of operations inside a transaction is able to reflect a specific business process. This allows Portals to set up and build services to achieve their specific goals.
