# Collective Intelligence Protocol

Intangible assets are the assets of the future and crucial components of the creative economy. Some of these assets are of a very high value and some of them are not. Due to the nature of intangible assets, it is quite difficult to evaluate such assets. However it is possible, and in most cases evaluation depends on the opinion of domain experts. When it comes to the evaluation of intangible assets, trust is important to properly judge the quality of evaluation from domain experts.

## CIP overview

DEIP Infrastructure provides a protocol that can potentially solve the trust problem in a radical way, by using our implementation of a **proof-of-reputation class of protocols - DEIP Collective Intelligence Protocol**. 

The Collective Intelligence Protocol is a part of the Decentralized Assessment System.

Decentralized Assessment System \(DAO\) - a set of tools, frameworks, protocols, and agent-based simulation to build multidimensional proof-of-reputation systems and combine them with crowdsourcing mechanisms.

The Collective Intelligence Protocol will be introduced during the first 2 years after the DEIP Infrastructure main net launch and has the potential to dramatically improve the efficiency of investments in intangible assets in the network, and even automate this process. 

To learn more about the Collective Intelligence Protocol and the Decentralized Assessment System please visit [the DAS website](https://deip.world/products/das/) or read a relevant [whitepaper](https://github.com/DEIPworld/DAS/blob/master/Decentralized%20Assessment%20System%20%28DAS%29%20-%20Description.pdf). Currently, the Collective Intelligence Protocol is being piloted in various use-cases, mostly in scientific and educational domains.
