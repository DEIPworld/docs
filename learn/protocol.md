# Protocol

DEIP Protocol \(the Intellectual Capital Protocol\) is a Web 3.0 Layer-2 application-specific protocol for intangible assets and derivatives. The protocol enables the discovery, evaluation, licensing, and exchange of intangible assets. It is designed specifically for intangible asset tokenization \(in the form of F-NFT\), governance \(via DAO\), and liquidity \(via DeFi instruments and derivatives\). 

DEIP Intellectual Capital Protocol is a fundamental protocol of the DEIP Infrastructure. It represents a set of operations that act like building blocks to compose solutions for Portal-specific services. 

Operation is the smallest unit of the protocol dedicated to modify the state of a blockchain relying on predefined rules. Multiple operations can be combined into a transaction to be executed atomically. A composition of operations inside a transaction is able to reflect a specific business process. This allows Portals to set up and build services to achieve their special goals.
