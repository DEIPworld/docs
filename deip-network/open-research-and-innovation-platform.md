# Open research and innovation platform

## What is the open research and innovation platform?

A huge potential of innovation and technology offers the chance to solve big societal problems in healthcare, urban mobility, and other issues. Governments around the world are stepping up their involvement and investments in this sector. Efficient evaluation of IP/intangible assets can be the most dramatic advantage.

That is why we created a digital platform to support open research and innovation activities.
