# No-code Constructor

DEIP's no-code mode Constructor does not require technical knowledge and programming skills, and portal building takes place using drag-n-drop UI modules. That's why it has been called "WordPress for Web 3.0": due to its simplicity of use and expansion of Web 3.0 space.

The launch of the no-code Constructor will be announced soon.
