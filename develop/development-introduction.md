# Development introduction

DEIP's flexible system allows you to build Web-3 infrastructure. It requires strong programming skills to immerse yourself in the low-level technical features of the technology to develop your custom solution based on the [Creator Economy Protocol](../learn/protocol/).

## Development guide

### Operations 

Describes supported operations and will receive ongoing updates as the protocol evolves.

### Substrate-based chain

Describes the blockchain implementation on the Polkadot Parity substrate. Uses WASM and Rust. 

{% page-ref page="substrate-based-chain/" %}

### Substrate-based chain docs

Introduces a module that connects to the Substrate-based chain and is needed only for[ Substrate-based ](substrate-based-chain/)blockchain.

### Graphene \(Legacy\)

Describes the blockchain implementation on the Graphene Framework. Uses C++.

{% page-ref page="legacy/deip-graphene/" %}

### Off-chain server  

Introduces the DEIP off-chain node.js server that assists each Portal. The DEIP off-chain server accumulates off-chain logic, and authorizes Portals for the DEIP Network.
