# Launch Roadmap

DEIP is rolling out the most advanced decentralized protocol for the creator economy. DEIP is not only about protocols. We are growing an ecosystem with a bunch of technologies, tools, and strategies for tokenization and governance of high-value intangible assets. 

We want you to be updated about our plans and future desired outcomes ðŸ”¥.
